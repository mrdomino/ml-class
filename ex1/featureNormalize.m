function [X_norm, mu, sigma] = featureNormalize(X)
%FEATURENORMALIZE Normalizes the features in X
%   FEATURENORMALIZE(X) returns a normalized version of X where
%   the mean value of each feature is 0 and the standard deviation
%   is 1. This is often a good preprocessing step to do when
%   working with learning algorithms.

mu = mean(X);
sigma = std(X);
X_norm = bsxfun(@rdivide, bsxfun(@minus, X, mu), sigma);
