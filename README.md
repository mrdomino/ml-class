# Machine Learning Class

This repo contains exercises and notes from the [Stanford online Machine
Learning course][ml-class]. Notes are kept up to date with my progress on the
video lectures.

Commits containing non-trivial programming exercise solutions are kept local
until after the exercise is due; e.g., for a due date of 19 May 2012 at 11:59:00
PM PDT, I'd push my solutions to Github on or after 20 May 2012.
