Week 1, Day 1

- Supervised learning: classification, regression problems; dataset includes
  labels or "right" answers already.
- Unsupervised learning: clustering; determining structure in data.

Variables used throughout course:

- $m$: number of items in dataset
- $y$: the answer, output of function
- $x$: inputs to function
- $h$: $x -> y$, hypothesis function
- $\theta$: coefficients of regression hypothesis function

    Single-variable linear regression
aka univariate      "      "

Single-variable: single input. $x$ is a 1d vector.

Find $h_\theta$ that's closest to the results.

That is, find $\theta_0, \theta_1$ in $h_\theta = \theta_0 + \theta_1 x$ so that
cost function
$J_{\theta_0, \theta_1} =
    1/2m \sum_{i=0}^m (h_\theta(x^(i)) - y)^2$
is minimal.
